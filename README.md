# UART Loopback sample for Android Things

This sample demonstrates basic data read and write operations over a UART.
The application creates a loopback interface that immediately echoes
any data read from the receive (RX) buffer to the transmit (TX) buffer.

## Pre-requisites

- Android Things compatible board with an available UART port
- Android Studio 2.2+
- [FTDI TTL-232R](http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/Cables/USBTTLSerial.htm)
or compatible USB-TTL converter

## Schematics

NOTE: on Raspberry Pi 3 you need to expose UART0 on the BCM14/BCM15 GPIO pins
by changing the boot configuration files to _Application Mode_, according to
these [instructions][pi3-instructions].

Check in the USB TTL cable's documentation for the TX and RX wire colors:
- connect the cable TX wire to the board RX pin
- connect the cable RX wire to the board TX pin

## Build and install

1. On Android Studio, click on the "Run" button.

If you prefer to run on the command line, type

```bash
./gradlew installDebug
adb shell am start com.example.androidthings.loopback/.LoopbackActivity
```

2. Plug the USB-TTL converter into a host PC, start your favorite terminal
program (minicom, screen, RealTerm, etc.), and connect to the USB-TTL port
at 115200 baud.

3. Type characters into the terminal and observe them echo back to you from the device.
